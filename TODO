Dev TODOs:
  + Add padding to main thatâ€™s the height of the nav
  + Increase / maximize click areas
  + PurgeCSS to reduce tailwind size
  + Add countdown component
  + Add social links
  + Finally got yarn v2 working on Netlify
  + make footer social media links
  + Add click on "Fag" fumonicon to go to "/"
  + Make visually active NAV
  + publish to `@f*g/`
  - move Svelte:window binds and resize to store
  - Big fumonicon is the page's fumonicon

Postlaunch:
  - Nav.svelte needs to be broken down into smaller components like I did for Social
  - consider adding a global SVG for common symbols

LAUNCH:
  Index:
    - WHY (future)
    - HOW (technology)
    - WHAT (projects)

  Akira:

    - lowercase
    - numbers
    - a few symbols
    - evolution 
    - future direction

  Fumonicons:
    - Principles
    - Seeking Collaboration
    - only import 1 way
