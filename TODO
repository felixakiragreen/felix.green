Small things:
	[-] Figure out why the favicon mask isn't working
	[x] use svh instead of vh for better mobile support

		/apple-touch-icon.png

Medium things:
	[x] IntersectionObserver on mobile, to highlight sections
	[x] Add links to relevant projects
	[ ] Project tooltips with links to deep dive
		[ ] Add a nanostore that holds the current hovered/expanded project
			As well as it's global position
		[ ] Add a tooltip component that takes the project and position

Big things:
	[ ] Add Project page with deep dive:
		Project Overview:	
			[ ] What it is
			[ ] How it works
			[ ] Why it's cool
			[ ] What I used
			[ ] What I did
			[ ] Where to find
		By the numbers:
			[ ] First commit
			[ ] Last commit
			[ ] Total commits
			[ ] Most commits in a day
			[ ] Total lines of code?
			[ ] Percentage of each programming language
	[ ] About me section
	[ ] By the numbers section
	[ ] Github timeline visualization
	
Other ideas:
