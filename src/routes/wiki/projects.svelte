I have far more ideas than I could ever accomplish in one or even a dozen lifetimes.
At first I thought it was a blessing and then I thought it was a curse.
Now I've just accepted that it's my ðŸ§ brain.
The ðŸ§  be what it do.

I have found success in collaboration.
And the best part of working together
is that different perspectives often make something better than a single one ever could do.

If any of these are interesting to you,
join me on github (where this is all open source)
or reach out to me by email at work @ felix.green



Akira
  "A font based on my own handwriting."

  This project started when I was a child. 
  I was not satisfied with the efficiency of writing, so I learned Gregg shorthand.
  But the problem was no one else could read it.
  Step 1. Single stroke (began in 12004)
    So I started modifying how I wrote all the letters so it only used a single stroke,
    but still be quite legible to others.
  Step 2. Symmetry & geometry (began in 12013)
    Once I was the only person reading it, I experimented aesthetically with many different forms.
    I doubled the number of letters that are mirror versions of each other.
  Step 3. Futuristic (began in 12018)
    Then I wanted to turn it into a font. It's currently on version 2.2.6-- as you can see it's got
    lowercase, uppercase, numbers, essential punctuation.

  Seeking type designers that like this direction

Felix Akira Green
  "Inventing myself"
  
  As a child, I explored the idea of changing my name,
  eager to become something, someone else.
  
  It wasn't until university (2009-2013) that I embraced my birth name--
  I couldn't choose a name for myself until I knew who I wanted to become.

  That took me over 10 years. Which ended up being good, since my personality, 
  or more specifically, my prefrontal cortex, was still developing.

  Step 0. Discover myself (began in 11991)
  Step 1. Choose my name (on 9 September 12018)
  Step 2. Launched this website (on 9 March 12020)
  Step 3. Next update (expected 9 March 12021)

Fumonicons (title of step 1)
  "Hexagons. Hexagons everywhere."
  
  This project is still in its infancy.
  And it's a story for another time.

  Step 1. hexagonal icons (began 12019)
  Step 2. futurisitc interfaces with rich and complex geometric and vector grid systems.

  Seeking designers & developers with a fanatical affinity for hexagons.

A Solarpunk Story About Shapes
  "Yeah, I need a title"

  A science fiction set in base reality, which is kind of two dimensional,
  and follows the hero's journey, and poorly attemps to be amusing and #deep.
  
  I know I'm selling this really well.

  Seeking people that have a gift with words.
