    I have more
    ðŸ’¡ ideas than I could ever
    accomplish in one or even a dozen lifetimes.
    At first I thought it was a
    blessing and then I thought it was a
    curse.
    Now I've just accepted that it's my ðŸ§ 
    brain.
    The ðŸ§ 
    be what it 
    do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have found success in collaboration.
    And the best part of working together
    is that different perspectives often make something better than a single one ever could do.

    <p>
      This project started when I was a child. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not satisfied with the efficiency of writing, so I learned Gregg shorthand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem was no one else could read it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>
          <span class="text-green-600">Step <Green>1</Green>.</span>
          Single stroke
          <Grey cls="-text-1">
            (began <abbr title="2004">12004</abbr>)
          </Grey>
        </h3>
        <p class="-ml-8">
          I started modifying how I wrote all the letters
          so it only used a single stroke,
          but still be quite legible to others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>
          <span class="text-green-600">Step <Green>2</Green>.</span>

          <Grey cls="-text-1">
            (began <abbr title="2013">12013</abbr>)
          </Grey>
        </h3>
        <p class="-ml-8">
          Once I was the only person reading it,
          I experimented aesthetically with many different forms.
          I doubled the number of letters that are mirror versions of each other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>

        <p class="-ml-8">
          Then I wanted to turn it into a font.
          It's currently on v2.2.6-
          <br />
          as you can see it's got:
          lowercase, uppercase, numbers, & essential punctuation.

      Inventing myself

    <p>
      As a child, I explored the idea of changing my name,
      eager to become something, someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't until university (<abbr title="2009 - 2013">12009-13</abbr>)
      that I embraced my birth name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't choose a name for myself until I knew who I wanted to become.
    </p>
    <p>
      That took me over 10 years. Which ended up being good, since my personality, 
      or more specifically, my prefrontal cortex, was still developing.
